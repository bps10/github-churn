<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/open-source">Open source development</a>
has produced millions of valuable products that are used by engineers around the world. 
The continued success of these projects, however, depends on a large and active community of 
developers willing to donate their time.
</p>
<p>
Consider the period between Jan-May 2016. During this time, there were 3.7 million users who had at least one 
open source event on GitHub. The probelm is that over the next 5 months 48% of those users 
made zero contributions. The goal of CodeChurn is to monitor and promote the 
health of the OS community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>CodeChurn helps you identify potential churners and suggests actions you can take
to prevent it from happening.</b>
</p>

<h3>Tech</h3>

<p>The prediction engine behind CodeChurn was built using data from <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/users/">
    GitHub's User api</a> and the publically available <a href="http://www.gharchive.org/">GitHub archive 
    </a> on Google BigQuery, which contains a record of all events on GitHub. 
    For more information about the model and how it was implemented
    visit the CodeChurn <a href="https://github.com/bps10/github-churn">github page </a>.

    as a part of the <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Fellows program</a>.
